#### Making your Page
If you want to make your own MyFaves page, this is the option for you
1. Before you make one, make sure to create a [Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441), 
	don't make a Chrome profile once you're done with it
	That is the easiest method to sign up in MyFaves, since it only supports Social Logins
2. Sign in via Google, make sure it is the account you created instead of your school account
3. Choose a username for your page, this is useful if you want to access your page from different devices without logging in
4. Once you're done, you will be directed to the Settings page of your site, where you can add, move, and edit icons
	You can use the [help page](https://www.myfav.es/settings/help/), if you're not sure how to use the site
	and You're Done!
